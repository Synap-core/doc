# Vision

**The mission and vision for Synap**

---

## Mission

**Create a System of Record for Human Thought**

Synap is not just an application, but an **ecosystem** that enables users to have complete sovereignty over their data while leveraging advanced AI as a symbiotic partner.

---

## Core Concept

**The Personal Data Pod**

A "bubble" of sovereign, isolated data belonging to each user, containing:
- Their knowledge base (notes, tasks, projects)
- Their action history (Event Store)
- Their semantic memory (Vector DB)

---

## Ecosystem Components

### 1. Synap Core OS (Data Pod)
- Open source backend
- Self-hostable
- Guardian of user data
- Headless API

### 2. The Architech
- CLI for code generation
- Plugin management
- Extension marketplace

### 3. Synap Client SDK
- Type-safe client library
- React integration
- Real-time support

### 4. Intelligence Ecosystem
- Plugin system for adding agents
- Marketplace for external services
- Extensible via LangGraph workflows

---

## Principles

### Data Sovereignty
Users own and control their data completely.

### Open Source
Core OS is open source and self-hostable.

### Extensibility
Two mechanisms: Internal plugins and external services.

### Type Safety
End-to-end type safety with TypeScript and Zod.

### Event-Driven
All state changes flow through events for auditability.

---

## Future

We envision a world where:
- Users have complete control over their digital knowledge
- AI acts as a partner, not a tool
- Extensibility enables infinite possibilities
- Open standards enable interoperability

---

**Next**: See [Roadmap](./roadmap.md) for development plans.
