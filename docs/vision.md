# Vision & Philosophy

> **Mission**: To become the standard for personal data sovereignty by proving that a privacy-first ecosystem can be more powerful, capable, and user-friendly than proprietary alternatives.

## The Problem: Techno-Feudalism

In the physical world, you have fundamental rights: ownership of your home, privacy within its walls, and stability in your environment. In the digital world, these rights have been eroded.

- **No Ownership**: You "rent" access to your data (Notion, Google, Apple).
- **No Privacy**: Your actions are surveilled and monetized.
- **No Stability**: Terms of Service and features change without your consent.

We call this **Techno-Feudalism**: you are both the tenant and the product.

## The Solution: Synap

Synap inverts the model. Instead of services owning your data, **you own your data** and grant services permission to use it.

### Core Value Proposition

1.  **Sovereignty**: Your data lives in your **Data Pod**, an encrypted, portable "digital home" that you control.
2.  **Interopability**: A universal standard allows different apps to work on the same data.
3.  **Intelligence**: Because AI has access to *all* your data (not just one silo), it can be exponentially more helpful.

## Architecture Philosophy

### 1. The "Data Pod" (Layer 1)
The infrastructure layer. An open standard for storing personal data.
- **Self-Hostable**: Can run on a Raspberry Pi or a managed cloud instance.
- **Encrypted**: Private by design.
- **Universal**: Stores contacts, notes, tasks, and events in standard formats.

### 2. Synap App (Layer 2)
The "Flagship" application. A proof-of-concept that demonstrates the power of the ecosystem.
- **Time-Travel Data**: Event-sourced architecture allows infinite undo and history replay.
- **Git-like Branching**: Conversations and workflows can branch for parallel exploration and merge back.
- **Multi-Agent AI**: A swarm of specialized agents (Researcher, Coder, Planner) collaborating to solve complex tasks.

### 3. The Marketplace (Layer 3)
An ecosystem of third-party applications that can interact with your Data Pod, creating a "network effect" of utility without compromising privacy.

## Key Differentiators

| Feature | Legacy SaaS (Notion, Google) | Synap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Ownership** | ❌ Locked in | ✅ Open-source & Portable |
| **Context** | ⚠️ Limited by token windows | ✅ Infinite (RAG + Knowledge Graph) |
| **Workflow** | Linear & Destructive | ✅ Branching & Non-destructive |
| **Privacy** | ❌ Surveillance Capitalism | ✅ User Sovereignty |

## Current Status (2025)

Synap is currently in **Beta**.
- **Backend**: Fully functional event-sourced architecture with Hub Protocol.
- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 + React 19 application with real-time collaboration.
- **AI**: Operational "Intelligence Hub" with multi-agent orchestration.

We are building the foundation for a new digital era where users are citizens, not products.
